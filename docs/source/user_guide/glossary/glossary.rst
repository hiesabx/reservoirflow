    mathephysineer
        a person who practices Mathephysineering professionally.

    mathephysineering
        a combination of Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering with the objective to improve our overall understanding especially with the power of other tools available from computer science and machine learning. *Mathephysineering* inspires to revisit the basics of mathematics required to describe and solve physical problems according to best engineering practices in order to achieve better practical applications.

    permeability
        permeability is a directional property and defined as the capacity of the grid cell to transmit fluid through its interconnected pores, check is_isotropic property.

    porosity
        rock porosity or effective porosity is a ratio of the volume of interconnected pores to the grid cell volume. Porosity is a volumetric ratio, check is_homogenous property.
