# v0.1.0 - Jan 01, 2024

This is the first version where ReservoirFlow was released to the world. After working several years on this project and sharing my progress on LinkedIn, publishing this library is indeed a unique moment for me. This point was already delayed several times due to huge technical and scientific challenges associated reservoir simulation especially when combined with machine learning (i.e. deep learning).
