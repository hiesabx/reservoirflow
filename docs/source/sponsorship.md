# Sponsorship and Support

```{warning}
This project has not been sponsored yet. We are seeking support especially from oil and gas operation companies and universities. If you are a company, a university, or an individual who could benefit from this work, please consider supporting this project.

## Sponsorship

Any open-source tool requires resources that cost both time and money. Although much of the open-source work is driven by the good intention of having an accessible and reproducible research, open-source has also proved to be a very successful business model especially when the tool grows to a production level.

To reach a stable production level, we will need enough investment to develop, upgrade, and maintain this tool. Here comes the role of oil & gas companies (i.e. especially operation companies) who may benefit a lot from this tool to sponsor this project. This will help us to dedicate more resources and to add new features (i.e. let it be Quantum Computing!) or fix some bugs.

If you are an individual who may benefit from this work, consider supporting this project by [Sponsorship on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/zakgrin) or by any means. Even by just starting to use this tool and reporting some errors or insights. If you can't then that is fine. Our main duty is to always keep this tool open-source.

## How Can I Support This Project?

There are two ways to support this project. One way is by [Sponsorship](#sponsorship). The other way is to offer some technical support as explained below.

**Normal Users:**

As a normal user, you can support this project in many ways:

- Give a star in GitHub for [`reservoirflow`](https://github.com/zakgrin/reservoirflow) (you need a GitHub Account).
- Start using `reservoirflow` for your projects or thesis.
- Compare `reservoirflow` with other commercial tools and openly share your feedback.
- Share your progress and experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) or any other platform. Use `#reservoirflow` hashtag, so the community can interact with your work. Mention [Zakariya Abugrin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zakariya-abugrin/), so the author can give you quick feedback.
- Report some issues you face under [Issues](https://github.com/zakgrin/reservoirflow/issues).

**Companies:**

If you are a company that may use this tool for commercial application, then the best way is to [Sponsorship](#sponsorship) this project. Additionally, you can do the following:

- Use this tool for your internal projects.
- In case new features are needed, then open a new request under [issues](https://github.com/zakgrin/reservoirflow/issues). In contrast, we also expect some [Sponsorship](#sponsorship), so we have the required resources to develop this feature specifically for you.
- Encourage your RE teams to participate in this project as developers and not only as normal users. If you do not have any, hire one who can do so.
- Use our future offers that we will announce later once the community grows enough (i.e. training, consultation, special use cases, etc.).
