About Us
========

We are *Hiesab*; a startup company founded in 2024 based in Germany and Libya specialized in advanced data analytics, scientific computing, and automation with a mission to accelerate R&D for AI applications and data solutions in different fields including Science, Engineering, and Education. We plan to be a strategic AI and data partner for universities and companies worldwide. Ultimately, we strive for the highest levels of precision in computing and analytics, all in the pursuit of promoting justice in transactions, management, and governance.

.. comment: 
    We acknowledge that our work is deeply inspired by the Holy Quran where achieving justice is an indispensable requirement for all humanity.

We seek to make knowledge freely available and accessible to everyone by providing open, accessible, specialized, and cutting-edge tools to be a central-unified platform for both industry and education where technological progress is standardized, cleansed, and redistributed with an objective to accelerate research and development and to offer a high-quality educational material with hands-on tutorials on a wide range of topics.

A large enough pool of collaboration with universities, companies, and developers throughout our platform will be utilized to provide not only a better education but also accelerated technological progress. Research outcomes will be used to update our tools which are then made available to universities to continue the development cycle. These tools then can be used in lectures to give students hands-on training and also to use them in their research or theses. Companies who sponsorship us will have the advantage of commercial-use, so they can directly make use of these new breakthroughs.

.. hint::
    This website is a demonstration of our concept. We are planning to release similar tools in the future.

By bringing together researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds, *Hiesab* aims to create an inclusive environment where innovation can thrive. This community will not only accelerate advancements in scientific computing and machine learning but also facilitate the translation of theoretical research into practical applications. To achieve this, *Hiesab* plans to organize workshops, hackathons, and seminars that will provide valuable opportunities for networking, knowledge sharing, and hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies. Additionally, by maintaining a comprehensive online platform, the community members will have access to a rich repository of tutorials, research papers, and code repositories, enabling continuous learning and collaboration. Ultimately, the vision for *ReservoirFlow* extends beyond mere technological advancement. It encompasses the creation of a vibrant, supportive ecosystem where knowledge is freely exchanged, challenges are collaboratively tackled, and groundbreaking solutions are developed. Together, we can push the boundaries of what is possible and make significant contributions to the scientific community and society at large.

Priority
--------

We prioritize strategic topics such as: energy and the environment focusing on innovation and efficiency. ``ReservoirFlow`` is our first tool that is designed to help the energy industry (mainly oil, gas, and underground energy storage companies) to become more efficient and data driven. Our goal is to reduce the carbon footprint of energy operations while enhancing productivity and sustainability. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning, we aim to empower automation in intelligent fields to transform the industry, making it more environmentally friendly, resilient and adaptive to future challenges.


Vision Statement
----------------

At *Hiesab*, our vision for AI is driven by a commitment to innovation and efficiency. We believe that the AI industry has become overly reliant on sheer computing power to create more capable models, often at the expense of developing more efficient algorithms. Our focus is on crafting intelligent systems that prioritize resource efficiency. Therefore, we redefine intelligence not merely as the ability of machines to simulate human intelligence but as the ability to do so using minimal resources. For us, true intelligence is demonstrated by a machine's capability to achieve accurate outcomes while consuming the least possible data and computing power. In this way, a machine that reaches the correct answer with fewer resources is inherently more intelligent than one that requires more. By championing efficiency and innovation, we aim to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve, fostering the development of smarter, more sustainable technologies that benefit society as a whole.


Our View on AI and AGI (a Disclaimer)
-------------------------------------

We do not subscribe to the hype surrounding AI where the term is often misused for marketing purposes. Our vision centers on making intelligent decisions through the use of specialized machine learning models that work together to optimize specific processes. By automating intelligent decision-making for particular tasks, we still refer to our approach as AI, or more specifically Weak (or narrow) AI. However, it is essential to distinguish this from Strong (or general) AI, also know as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), where the goal is to create machines with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human intelligence. Our focus remains on task-specific intelligence, ensuring practical and efficient solutions rather than pursuing the broader, more generalized aspirations of AGI. However, AGI will still be a research topic for us, as we explore the potential and boundaries of intelligent systems.


Philosophy of ``ReservoirFlow``
-------------------------------

Our Philosophy is to try to attack the same problem from multiple angles by combining different solutions including analytical solutions, numerical solutions, and neurical solutions (i.e. solutions based on artificial neural networks). Studying different techniques to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) of fluid flow problems gives great insight into developing more efficient solutions. However, this requires a combination of wide range of topics especially Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering, or what we shortly refer to as Mathephysineering. With the objective to improve the practical applications, Mathephysineering can improve our overall understanding especially with the power of other tools and technologies available from computer science and machine learning. Mathephysineering inspires us to revisit the basics of mathematics required to better describe and solve physical problems using multiple solutions and according to best engineering practices. This is the philosophy behind developing this tool as demonstrated within this project.
