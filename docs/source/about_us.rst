About Us
========

We are *Hiesab*; an international startup company founded in 2024 based in  Tripoli, Libya specialized in advanced data analytics, scientific computing, and automation with a mission to accelerate R&D for AI applications and data solutions in different fields including Science, Engineering, and Education. We plan to be a strategic AI and data partner for universities and companies worldwide. Ultimately, we strive for the highest levels of precision in computing and analytics, all in the pursuit of promoting justice in transactions, management, and governance.

We seek to make knowledge freely available and accessible to everyone by providing open, accessible, specialized, and cutting-edge tools to be a central-unified platform for both industry and education where technological progress is standardized, cleansed, and redistributed with an objective to accelerate research and development and to offer a high-quality educational material with hands-on tutorials on a wide range of topics.

A large enough pool of collaboration with universities, companies, and developers throughout our platform will be utilized to provide not only a better education but also accelerated technological progress. Research outcomes will be used to update our tools which are then made available to universities to continue the development cycle. These tools then can be used in lectures to give students hands-on training and also to use them in their research or theses. Companies who sponsorship us will have the advantage of commercial-use, so they can directly make use of these new breakthroughs.

.. hint::
    This website is a demonstration of our concept. We are planning to release similar tools in the future.

By bringing together researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds, *Hiesab* aims to create an inclusive environment where innovation can thrive. This community will not only accelerate advancements in scientific computing and machine learning but also facilitate the translation of theoretical research into practical applications. To achieve this, *Hiesab* plans to organize workshops, hackathons, and seminars that will provide valuable opportunities for networking, knowledge sharing, and hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies. Additionally, by maintaining a comprehensive online platform, the community members will have access to a rich repository of tutorials, research papers, and code repositories, enabling continuous learning and collaboration. Ultimately, the vision for our products (e.g. *ReservoirFlow*) extends beyond mere technological advancement. It encompasses the creation of a vibrant, supportive ecosystem where knowledge is freely exchanged, challenges are collaboratively tackled, and groundbreaking solutions are developed. Together, we can push the boundaries of what is possible and make significant contributions to the scientific community and society at large.

Philosophy of ``ReservoirFlow``
-------------------------------

Our Philosophy is to try to attack the same problem from multiple angles by combining different solutions including analytical solutions, numerical solutions, and neurical solutions (i.e. solutions based on artificial neural networks). Studying different techniques to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) of fluid flow problems gives great insight into developing more efficient solutions. However, this requires a combination of wide range of topics especially Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering, or what we shortly refer to as Mathephysineering. With the objective to improve the practical applications, Mathephysineering can improve our overall understanding especially with the power of other tools and technologies available from computer science and machine learning. Mathephysineering inspires us to revisit the basics of mathematics required to better describe and solve physical problems using multiple solutions and according to best engineering practices. This is the philosophy behind developing this tool as demonstrated within this project.
