About Us
========

*ReservoirFlow* <``reservoirflow``> is a modern open-source Python library developed by `Bayanatics <https://github.com/zakgrin>`_. *Bayanatics*, is a startup company specialized in advanced data analytics and scientific computing, founded by `Zakariya Abugrin <https://github.com/zakgrin>`_ in 2024 with a mission to provide open, accessible, specialized, modern, and cutting-edge solutions and tools to be a central unified platform for both industry and education where technological progress is shared, standardized, cleansed, and redistributed with an objective to accelerate research and development and to offer a high-quality educational material with hands-on experience on a wide range of topics in both Science and Engineering. *Bayanatics* is not limited to oil & gas industry.

A large enough pool of collaboration with universities and companies throughout our platform will be utilized to provide not only a better education but also a unified, accelerated, and shared technological progress.

Companies who choose to collaborate with us, will get additional benefits including commercial use, shape our tools (e.g. custom features), trainings, and more. Collaboration with universities is essential ideally with some funding but not necessary as long as we have enough resources to collaborate. Research outcomes are used to update our tools which are then made available to universities to continue the development cycle. These tools then can be used in lectures to give students hands-on training and also to use them in their research or theses.
