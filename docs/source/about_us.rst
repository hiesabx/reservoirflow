About Us
========

*ReservoirFlow* is a modern open-source Python library developed by `Zakariya Abugrin <https://github.com/zakgrin>`_ (Founder and CEO of Bayanatics). *Bayanatics* is a startup company specializing in advanced data analytics and scientific computing founded in 2024 with a mission to provide open, accessible, specialized, modern, and cutting-edge solutions and tools to be a central-unified platform for both industry and education where technological progress is shared, standardized, cleansed, and redistributed with an objective to accelerate research and development and to offer a high-quality educational material with hands-on experience on a wide range of topics in Science, Engineering, and Technology.

A large enough pool of collaboration with universities and companies throughout our platform will be utilized to provide not only a better education but also a unified, accelerated, and shared technological progress. Companies who choose to collaborate with us, will get additional benefits including commercial use, shaping our tools (e.g. custom features), trainings, and more. Collaboration with universities is essential ideally with some funding but not necessary as long as we have enough resources to collaborate. Research outcomes are used to update our tools which are then made available to universities to continue the development cycle. These tools then can be used in lectures to give students hands-on training and also to use them in their research or theses.

.. note::
    This website is a demonstration of our concept. We are planning to release more websites to cover a wider range of topics. Throughout our websites and platforms authors will have the chance to access bigger audiences, chat with them, and also provide tutorials with references for their work.

Philosophy
----------
Our Philosophy is to try to attack the same problem from multiple angles by combining different solutions including analytical solutions, numerical solutions, and machine learning solutions (which we call neurical solutions). Studying different solution techniques to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) gives great insight into developing more efficient solutions. However, this requires a combination of wide range of topics especially Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering, or what we shortly refer to as Mathephysineering. With the objective to improve the practical applications, Mathephysineering can improve our overall understanding especially with the power of other tools and technologies available from computer science and machine learning. Mathephysineering inspires us to revisit the basics of mathematics required to better describe and solve physical problems using multiple solutions and according to best engineering practices. This is the philosophy behind developing this tool as will be demonstrated within this project.
