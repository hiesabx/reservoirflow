=============================
Are You a Reservoir Engineer?
=============================

Accessible and reproducible research is very scarce in the oil & gas industry. This unfortunate reality led many reservoir engineers to be limited and dependent on commercial tools that are closed black-boxes which led to severe limitations when it comes to skills and innovation. For example, most reservoir engineers today can not easily express their scientific knowledge by coding and normally are not trained to do so. This perhaps is the main reason why the oil & gas industry is still behind in the AI revolution.

We believe that this sad reality has to be changed as soon as possible. Reservoir engineers face difficult challenges in getting careers in or outside the oil & gas industry mainly due to the lack of soft skills. Otherwise, a reservoir engineer, who has a great mix of science (i.e. mathematics, statistics, scientific computing, programming, chemistry, physics, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, geology, etc.), should have no reason to stay unemployed.

This sad reality can be changed if reservoir engineers are trained to express their scientific and engineering knowledge with coding. In addition, this will bring more excitement and job satisfaction. Those who learn to do reservoir simulation in Python should be familiar with the modern scientific computing and machine learning stack in Python. Therefore, it will be easier for them to change careers and work as data scientists, data analysts, or ML engineers in other industries.
