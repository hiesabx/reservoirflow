Why do we need ReservoirFlow? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
===================================

You may ask, why is this library relevant? The answer is easy! Everyone of us deals with fluid flow in porous media perhaps even daily. Arguably, the most common one is when you brew your espresso, you will not get a coffee until a fluid flow in porous media takes place before the coffee reaches your cup. Things can get more complex if you would like to drill a water well in your garden. Even bigger, when you want to store :math:`CO_2` underground to reduce emissions.

What if you want to understand this behavior? What happens if you have multiple fluids flowing together underground (i.e. in porous media)?

This topic was deeply investigated by the petroleum industry since understanding the fluid flow from underground to the surface is essential to quantifying the performance of oil and gas fields. Over decades, petroleum reservoir simulation books were published with rich knowledge from multiple areas touching a wide range of topics from Mathematics and Engineering simultaneously. Unfortunately, most of the petroleum reservoir simulation software are commercial black-box leaving us in the dark when it comes to understanding the details of this complicated process. Hence, this library is offered as open-source to help students, engineers, and researchers to simulate and understand this process. Moreover, *ReservoirFlow* is in fact very competent in many ways and allows for efficient computing in addition to combining different solutions and focuses on taking the whole topic to the next level.
