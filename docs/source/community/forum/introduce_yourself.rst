Introduce Yourself ðŸ‘‹
======================

We are looking forward to forming a strong community with a lot of interesting activities including collaborations, trainings and boot camps for this project and more other interesting projects that we will work on in the future. 

If you want to be part of our community, it would be great to introduce yourself below. 
This will allow us to know each other better.

    Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 
    
    Iâ€™m Zakariya, the author of _ReservoirFlow_, Founder and CEO of _Hiesab_, 

    I am a Data Scientist and Data Engineer at [Schaeffler](https://www.linkedin.com/company/schaeffler/mycompany/verification/). I have more than 5 years of experience working on data science projects mainly related to analytics, computing, and simulation. I am a master of data science graduate from [Frankfurt School](https://www.frankfurt-school.de/home). Before studying data science, I worked as a reservoir simulation engineer and did a master's degree in petroleum reservoir engineering and business management at [TU Clausthal](https://www.tu-clausthal.de/). I also did my bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering at [University of Tripoli](https://uot.edu.ly/index.php?lang=en). Scientific computing and engineering are both essential parts of my background. Adding data science to my background has helped me to be a proficient scientist/engineer who can test and prove scientific knowledge by coding. 

    Currently, I am doing my PhD in applied mathematics at [Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t
    Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.de) focusing on scientific computing where much of this work is actually integrated in _ReservoirFlow_. My PhD is actually the backbone of the startup _Hiesab_ and this is my challenge for the following years. I hope that you will benifit from this challenging project. 

    A large part of my research is largely inspired by the Holy Quran where I found mathematical and physical concepts that lead to several breakthroughs. My research is not just about computing but also about finding deep meanings for what we do especially making knowledge accessible to everyone. Following the recommendations mentioned in the Holy Quran, I focus on accuracy and precision in calculation to help everyone to achieve justice in transactions, management, and governance. I will share more about this in the future.
