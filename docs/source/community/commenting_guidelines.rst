Commenting Guidelines
=====================

Note that comments' section is activated throughout the entire Documentation. The main reason to do so, is to allow sharing and discussing ideas where the community can be engaged in the details of this library. However, this adds some responsibility to keep the comments' section as professional as possible. 

Therefore, we suggest the following points as a guideline: 
    * always make sure that your comment is to the point.
    * avoid unnecessary comments (e.g., hello, thanks, first comment etc.).
    * do not repeat your comments.
    * harmful/unrelated links are not allowed.

.. warning::

    Our team has no responsibility over what users write. 

.. note::

    Comments can be deleted or locked if they are outdated or do not meet the conditions.
