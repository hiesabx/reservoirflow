# Support Us

```{warning}
This project has not been funded or sponsored yet. We are seeking support especially from oil and gas operation companies (both IOCs and NOCs). If you are a company, a university, or an individual who could benefit from this work, please consider supporting this project.

Any open-source tool requires resources that cost both time and money. Although much of the open-source work is driven by the good intention of having an accessible and reproducible research, open-source has also proved to be a very successful business model especially when the tool grows to a production level. With enough support, *Bayanatics* as a start-up company focused on analytics and computing will be able to offer open and accessible cutting edge research and solutions based on AI and best engineering practices. *ReservoirFlow* is mainly aimed for the oil & gas industry, but our vision is far beyond that.

## Funding

Our mission is to provide an accessible and open-source tools that can be used by students and universities in their curriculum from different departments including mathematics, physics, and engineering. To expand our scope of work, we need funding to build more tools with high quality educational materials.

## Sponsorship

To reach a stable production level, we will need enough investment to develop, upgrade, and maintain our tools. Here comes the role of oil & gas companies (i.e. especially operation companies) who may benefit a lot from such tools to sponsor this project. This will help us to dedicate more resources and to add new features (i.e. let it be Quantum Computing!) or fix some bugs. In return, sponsors can contribute to shaping our tools we develop with more additional benefits including commercial use.

If you are an individual who may benefit from this work, consider supporting this project by [Sponsorship on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/zakgrin) or by any means even by just using this tool and reporting some errors or insights. If you can't then that is fine. Our main duty is to always keep this tool open-source.
