    Register for Collaboration


Regardless of your type of collaboration, we recommend you to register for a collaboration. To register, please click register and fill in *ReservoirFlow Collaboration Form*. Based on that, we can schedule a meeting to align your objectives within the scope of this library. Upon a successful registration, you will be officially added as a collaborator with a dedicated page and workspace and get a *Collaboration-ID* (``colab_id``) that you can use to tag your files and branches, so we can then track and approve your contributions.

.. hint::
    We will provide more documentation for collaboration required to update pages, codes, studies etc. 

.. important::
    Since our work is hosted by GitHub, please read the terms of services `GitHub Terms of Service <https://github.com/github/site-policy/blob/1263bf0164cfe60d0900e70ba9126855c7c23c6c/Policies/github-terms-of-service.md>`_.
