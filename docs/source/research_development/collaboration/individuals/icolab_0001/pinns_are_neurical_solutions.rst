PINNs are Neurical Solutions üñãÔ∏è
===============================
*Author: Zakariya Abugrin | Date: August 2024*

Unlike most of the research where PINNs are considered as a numerical solution, in my research I argue that PINNs deserve to be classified under a different solution category which I call neurical solutions. In my research this is a fundamental classification and not just a terminology gymnastic. In addition, I am focusing on making PINNs practical and more efficient by achieving compatibility between differential equations and physics informed neural networks.
