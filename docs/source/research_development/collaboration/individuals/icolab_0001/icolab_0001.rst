I am delighted to have this space to share my research and engage with the community. Much of my work is conducted within the framework of my PhD in applied mathematics at `FAU <https://www.fau.de/>`_. My research is focused on scientific computing to solve differential equations for fluid flow problems using different techniques including analytical solutions, numerical solutions, and neurical solutions (i.e. solutions based on artificial neural networks). For neurical solutions, I am focusing mainly on physics informed neural networks (PINNs).
