R&D
===

This section is dedicated to research and development (R&D) topics including collaboration with companies, universities, or individuals. *ReservoirFlow* is still far from perfect and the main objective of having this R&D section is to continue developing this tool to reach a production level (i.e., a stable version with most of the functionalities and features used in Reservoir Simulation).

This section is an essential reference for developers, engineers, scientists, students, and researchers who want not only to learn about reservoir simulation but also to contribute to this library. Contributors who meat the code of conduct of this project with one or more successful pull requests will be added to the contributors' section in the following release note announced under `Release Notes <../release_notes/release_notes.html>`_.
